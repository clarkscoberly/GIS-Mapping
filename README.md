# GIS-Mapping
My first attempt at using GIS mapping tools

# Overview
I have always loved mapping things and a few weeks ago I discovered the tools to actually try mapping something on my own. Enter GIS mapping. 

The source of my data and getting started has been the ArcGIS mapping website. Their tutorials were a ton of help and propelled me into learning something of my own volition to further my personal software careear.

Writing this software was supposed to help me press forward into becoming my own software engineer. Pressing against the boundaries that I had set myself within and attempting to make something my own.

Below is a link to my youtube demonstration of what is a start to GIS mapping.

# Development Environment

ArcGIS mapping web services were my primary development environment. 

# Useful Websites

Helpful Websites in my process
* [ArcGis](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html)
* [Learn ArcGIS](https://learn-arcgis-learngis.hub.arcgis.com/)

# Future Work

* Make a GIS map from scratch in JS
* Change the population density map to be in squares to circles
* Get real world data to update automatically within the markers placed on the map.
